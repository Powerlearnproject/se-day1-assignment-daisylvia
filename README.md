Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
  Software engineering is the structured application of engineering methods, principles and tools to develop and maintain high quality software systems.
  Importance - it enables the creation of software applications and systems that imporove different aspects of life such as education, entertainment, communication or business


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
  Development of programming languages eg C
  Establishment of software engineering as a discipline in 1960s
  Advent of structured programming in the 1970s
  The rise of agile methodologies in 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
  Requirements - gather and record user needs and system requirements
  Design - Create detailed designs of software architecture and user interface
  Implementation - Write the code according to the design specifications
  Testing - Conduct tests to ensure the software meets the set quality standards and functionality
  Deployment - Release the software to users
  Maintenance - Providing support, updates and software enhancements
      

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
  Waterfall involves the sequential approach with distinct phases e.g. requirements, design, implementation flowing downwards while 
  Agile methodology involves the iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
   Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions
   Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans
   Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
  Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code e.g. Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ 
  Version Control Systems (VCSS) are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members e.g. Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
  Requirements may change during the development cycle leading to project delays
  Tight deadlines in terms of delivery which can compromise quality of software products
  Technical debt which accrues from shortcuts and using below optimum solutions which increases maintenance costs
  Strategies - Effective communication from both users and developers
               priotitizing tasks
               Regularly reassessing project goals and timelines
               Use of agile methodology

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
   Unit Testing - Testing individual components or modules of software
   Integration Testing - Testing interactions between different components or subsystems
   System Testing - Testing the entire software system as a whole
   Acceptance Testing - Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
  prompt engineering is all about crafting your questions or instructions in a way that helps get the best responses from your robot or AI assistant
  Importance - Helps give you the best answer quickly

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
  "Give procedure of writing a CV"
  "Give procedure of writing a CV for a recent graduate in the field of Information Technology"
  The improved CV will provide a CV within the context of someone with no work experience and in will help highlight the skills in information technology unlike the previous one which would provide a random CV of any gaduate in any field with even more years of experience
